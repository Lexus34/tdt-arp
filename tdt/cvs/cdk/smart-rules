# These rules are smarter ;)
# semicolumn eaquals line break, rules are separated by one of them
# all traling whitespaces are ignored, use them for pretier indetation
# so this:
#   megaproject; v2.0; file://hello_world.c;
# and this:
#   megaproject
#     v2.0
#     file://hello_world.c;
# are the same
# 
# double semicolumn or semicolumn + linebreak or double linebreak or even linebreak + semicolumn
# can be used for separating packages
#
# first three rules are not exactly "rules" they are corresponding to package name, package version
# and build subdirectory.
#
# each next rule is in "command:argument" format
# for example
#   extract:http://someserver.com/pacakge-2.1.tar.gz
# by the way, extract is the default command, so you can type just
#   http://someserver.com/pacakge-2.1.tar.gz
# if you want only to copy a file to the build directory use
#   nothing:http://someserver/logo.png
# other available commands are
#   dirextract - first cd to build directory, than extract
#   patch - apply as patch
#   rpmbuild - building from rpm package
# these are most common tasks, see smart-rules.pl for details and feel free to add more..
# However, some special rules is better to write directly to .mk file
#
# To make rules quite you can use two special words, {PN} and {PV} which refers to package name and version.
#
# Now consider sources that are suppored:
#  http:// - http wget download
#  ftp:// - ftp wget download
#  file:// - look for file in Pathes directory
# svn and git coming soon...
#
# if rule command doesn't match ones listed above, this is treated as install/uninstall rule.
# 
# below you can see mew lirc rule, which replaces corresponding entries in rules-make, rules-install and rules-archive
# It is much less complicated !
# lirc
#   0.9.0
#   {PN}-{PV}
#   extract:http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lirc/{PN}-{PV}.tar.gz
#   patch:file://{PN}-{PV}-try_first_last_remote.diff
#   make:install:DESTDIR=TARGETS
#   rewrite-libtool:TARGETS/usr/lib/liblirc_client.la
